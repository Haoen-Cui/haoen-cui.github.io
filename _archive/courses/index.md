### [Undergraduate Transcript](https://hcui10.shinyapps.io/haoen_cuis_course_description/)
The above link is an `R Shiny` application displaying my full academic history at UIUC.   
Please close the application after use. With a free account, the app only has *limited* active hours per month.   
*(If the above link fails, please try [this link](https://haoencui.shinyapps.io/haoen_cuis_course_description/) instead. Again, same limitation applies. If both servers are down, please download the application from [here](https://github.com/hcui10/hcui10.github.io/blob/master/courses/app.R) and run it locally (preferably using RStudio). As a last resort, one can download the Excel file from [this link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XzVYwz8KoWf_lnvAvC7mgEJXsxLVU8dM).)*

* __*NOTE*__:   
  "N/A" means "Forgotten", "Not Applicable", "None", or "Does Not Exist";   
  `Textbook` = "Unknown" means that I don't know the textbooks used because I did not sit in the courses.
